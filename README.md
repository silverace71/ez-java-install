# ez-java-install
If your system of choice uses apt or pacman (debian/arch) then this is a super easy way to install openjdk onto your system!

# ***SCRIPT***
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/silverace71/ez-java-install/main/install-java.sh && sudo chmod +x install-java.sh && ./install-java.sh
```
# **INFO**
This will work on systems that have apt or pacman but do note that I haven't tested this on arch systems, so good luck!
